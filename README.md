# Movie Recommender System (by using a Streamlit App) 

## Summary

This project involves building a ** movie recommender system** as a Streamlit web app. It recommends movies to both new and existing users based on a combination of **content-based filtering**, **collaborative filtering**, and **popularity-based models**. The app uses real-world movie datasets and offers filtering options, poster visuals, and user session handling.

It’s a great project if you're interested in recommender systems, data pipelines, real-world APIs, and deploying interactive machine learning applications.

## Which technologies & tools to use?

### Language
- **Python** 

### Libraries
- **`pandas`** — for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **`joblib`** — to efficiently save/load DataFrames across notebooks and scripts.
- **`numpy`** — for array operations and generating unique IDs.
- **`surprise`** — to implement collaborative filtering (user-based predictions).
- **`scikit-learn`** — used for modeling, including RandomForest (box office prediction).
- **`streamlit`** — to build and deploy the interactive web app.

### Data Storage
- **joblib** — for fast model/data serialization.
- **csv files** — for storing cleaned or dimensional data.

### Visualization
- **matplotlib** — basic plotting and visual exploration of data.

## The different approaches to make predictions

### Content-Based Filtering
- Recommends movies based on similarity in **actors**, **genres**, **directors**, **writers**, and **producers**.
- Uses metadata to find similar titles to those a user already likes.
- Cold Start Handling: This approach is ideal for new users with no prior ratings.

### Collaborative Filtering
- Based on user-user or item-item similarities derived from rating patterns.
- Uses **matrix factorization** via the `surprise` library’s **SVD** algorithm.
- Requires historical user ratings for effective predictions.

### Hybrid Filtering
- Combines the strengths of:
  - **Content-based filtering**
  - **Collaborative filtering**
  - **Popularity-based suggestions**
- Allows more robust and accurate recommendations, especially for users with some but not many ratings.

## Data Sources

- [IMDB Datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)
- [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) 
- [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) 
- [MovieLens 100k](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

## Project Structure Overview

### Data prep. notebooks
- Multiple Jupyter notebooks for **cleaning**, **merging**, and **enriching** data from
  **IMDb**, **TMDB**, **OMDB**, **MovieLens**
- Each source has a dedicated ETL pipeline to create structured and usable datasets.

### Data pipelines
- End-to-end pipelines to **Extract**, **Transform**, and **Load** data into a unified, feature-rich df ready for modeling and recommendations.

### Streamlit application
- **`film_recommender.py`** — contains the core `FilmRecommender` class with all logic.
- **`app.py`** — the main entry point for the **Streamlit web interface**, managing user interaction, navigation, and session handling.
